# IT Job Logger

### Here is the link to the live website: [IT Job Logger](http://tylercasperson.github.io/it_logger/)

There is no registration required.

This was built from a [Brad Traversy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/).

You are able to add your technichians and assign jobs to them. Add/Delete jobs. Add/Delete techs. Could be applied to other areas that have jobs and people needing to complete those jobs.

Another application that I designed started to have a lot of code that could have been written better. So I looked for a better way and found a tutorial to help me code cleaner.
