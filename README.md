# IT Logger

### There is no live website for this application. I used json-server for my database, which stores the data in a text file. This is a great tool! I don't want to change it.

## Usage

- npm install
- npm run dev
  - Opens:
  - frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Server http://localhost:5000
  - db.json contains data

---

There is no registration required.

This was built from a [Brad Traversy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/).

You are able to add your technichians and assign jobs to them. Add/Delete jobs. Add/Delete techs. Could be applied to other areas that have jobs and people needing to complete those jobs.

Another application that I designed started to have a lot of code that could have been written better. So I looked for a better way and found a tutorial to help me code cleaner.
